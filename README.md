Project Description
GoSpot is an interactive web application that helps users discover nearby hangout spots with live crowd status and location-based filtering options.

The Problem statement
College students often struggle to find best local spots to hang out, socialize, and unwind after a long day of classes or studying. With numerous cafes, restaurants, parks, and entertainment venues around, it can be overwhelming and time-consuming to identify the most popular and student-friendly options in a specific area.

The Solution
Never waste a free hour not knowing what to do again! GoSpot solves this problem by providing students with an easy-to-use platform that offers real-time insights into the crowd status and busy hours of nearby venues. By aggregating user-generated updates and personalized recommendations, the app helps students find ideal hangout spots while avoiding overcrowded places, ensuring a more enjoyable and stress-free experience.
